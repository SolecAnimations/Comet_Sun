When I was making my Ice Consistancy mod, I made Dark Bramble's tail absolutely *gigantic*. After I mentioned this on the modding discord, Bob (username robbie_is_here) said to make it bigger. I did. And then again. And again. And again, until the very game crashed.
So I released the most tame-yet-still-cool looking variation under this repo.
